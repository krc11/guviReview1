# Core Java Chat Application

A simple console-based Chat/User Registry Application built using **Core Java**, structured with a **layered architecture**, and using **File I/O** for persistence. This app demonstrates basic **CRUD operations**, **input validation**, and **error handling** in a clean modular format.
